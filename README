This is a collection of my favorite vimrc/gvimrc settings along with my favorite color scheme (wombat) and Javascript indenting and syntax highlighting that *actually works*.  

I made this after getting sick of hunting down the correct javascript indent/syntax plugins because the built in ones just don't work.  

Some features/personalities of these settings:
* Remove all toolbars/scrollbars/menus from gvim
* Use Consolas as the font (works on Linux with the PowerPointViewer cabextract'ed or Windows).  I usually change this to Monaco on OS X.
* Correct Javascript indentation for object literal syntax and other normal use.
* Wombat, my favorite color scheme for vim, modified to remove italic text in strings
* Two spaces, no tabs
* Ctrl-t to open new tabs.  Alt-left and Alt-right (arrow keys) to switch between tabs, though I've stopped using this in favor of gt and gT
* Some other tweaks.
